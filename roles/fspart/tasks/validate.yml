# This file provides all tasks related to filesystem and 
# partition management.
# Although it can make /tmp on its own tmpfs partition, it does
# not set any other partition as the idea of this role is 
# security related, so it will just report deviations.
# Since partitioning is not something that happens constantly,
# validating that a specific partition exists and that it is
# mounted with correct options is enough.
